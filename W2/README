## Overview

This project aims to practice machine learning skills by creating a simple predictive model using the **Iris dataset**. The model predicts the class of iris flowers based on their features using basic machine learning algorithms. 

### Task Overview
1. **Dataset**:
   - Utilizes the Iris dataset for classification tasks.
   - Handles data preprocessing by cleaning missing values and normalizing features.

2. **Model**:
   - Implements a basic model using **Decision Tree Classifier**.
   - Evaluates the model's performance with metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix.

3. **Prediction**:
   - Makes predictions on new samples based on the trained model.

### Optional Features:
- Visualizes model performance through confusion matrices and feature importance.
- Experiments with an additional model using **Random Forest Classifier**.
- Deploys the model as a web application using Flask or Streamlit (if desired).
